The smallest possible complete Windows application
From the episode "Hello, Assembly" on Dave's Garage:

- Current code is in the folder "Lasse"
- Original code in the folder "TinyOriginal"
- QRCode is dead code, was the exe embedded into a QRCode, kept just for posterity

The goal of this project is to make the smallest possible application, without compression, that has the following features:
  - Runs a Windows message loop
  - Has a title bar, minimize, maximize, and close buttons, which all work as expected
  - Has a system menu with the same
  - Paints the background and some text centered in the middle, equal to or larger than "Dave's Tiny App"
  
Please keep it readable and explain what you're doing in the comments!  And the smaller, the better!
